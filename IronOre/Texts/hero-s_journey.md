## Departure

#### Month 1


- week 1: < prologue >
Cassy is a model university student with perfect grades and attendance.Young Cassy 
is fascinated by the world of computer science. In particular, Cassy is amazed by 
programming langueges. One day, after watching a video where the youtuber wrote a 
simple programming languege in a few hours, Cassy gets inspired to make one,
simply for the sake of the experience.


However, Cassy doesn't have any ideas for the shape of the languege, nor does Cassy
think Cassy has enough free time to actually work and finish the languege, so Cassy 
postpones this adventure for later.

The adventure is revived, months later, when Cassy is inspired by an article that 
compares existing langueges, and then Cassy notices a gap, a misterious feature that
none of the langueges have but Cassy is sure it will revolutionase the industry if 
Cassy manages to create it. 

With this Cassy start off by doing even more research into how langueges actually 
work. Cassy stumbles uppon the wonderful world of parsers, tokenizers, abstract 
sintax trees the ellusive assembly languege.

While working on the lang,Cassy find that Cassy doesn't have enough time to both give
enough development time for the game and to get maximum grades at university.

At one of the lectures, Cassy get's inpired by the words of one of the teachers, "if
you're feeling sick or simply don't feel like going to lectures, it's ok to stay at 
home or sleep longer, you are more important than your grades." and realises that 
getting the best results in uni isn't the be all end all.

From that point, Cassy has figured a plan on how to get good enough grades, be absent
from as many pairs as allowed, and still pass the university, all while having extra 
time for working on the languege.

## Initiation

---
- week 2: < nothing relevant to the plot happens , just gameplay>
< this week serves as a tutorial for the player >




---
- week 3:



Cassy, in the second month of uni has a choice to either go to a party to relax
and communicate with peers, stay at home and relax or work further on the languege.

---
>  <i>go to party</i>       = a bit less progress, less stress, gains a friend/ally
	Cassy decides to go to the party to relax more and talk with peers. There Cassy
	ends up talking about their project, and while discussing it, gains a friend 
	(that will help them in the future)
---

>  <i>go home and relax</i> = less stress
	Cassy doesn't want to sociolise and decides to relax at home
---

> <i>work on languege</i>  = more progress, more stress
	Cassy decides that time is limited and working is more important than relaxing.
---




---
- week 4 : < just gameplay >

< if the player goes to uni that week, they would know that next week a very 
important person will attend to give a talk >




---
- week 5 :


< if the player actually goes to uni >

That day, a famous programmer comes to uni to speak about programming and 
programming langueges.

---

> <i> Pay attention to the presentation </i> = less stress
	Cassy is very impressed and inspired by his speach.
	Cassy thinks of doing up to the guest and talk about Cassy's project.
	The guest is impressed by Cassy's ideas and gives Cassy's his contact info
	so Cassy could ask him for advice if needed.
---

> <i> Work on languege</i> = more progress, more stress
---

> <i> Study something else</i> = more knowledge, more stress
---




---
- week 6: < just gameplay >




---


- week 7: 
Cassy will encounter a vicious bug in the languege. The parser uses recursive descent
fir parsing mathematical expresions, however, for some reason certain expressions 
cause an infinite loop.

The bug is discovered

---
>   <i> try to rewrite the parser <fix the bug correctly> </i> = 
	Cassy decides it's better to try to rewrite the parser and check against the 
	current implementation. While rewriting, Cassy find multiple errors/bugs 
	<include bug description> and fixes them on the second rewrite. 
	< Due to this choice, the bug is fixed relatively quickly and there is time for the second day to study/relax/work more> 

---

>   <i> try and fix the current implementation <fix the bug incorrecly> </i> = 
	<get to make progress, but no time to study>
	Cassy is sure that the current implementaion is mostly correct and the bug should
	not be that hard to fix. However, after fixing the bug, another bug occurs <second bug description>
	< Due to this choice, the player has to waste another day to fix the parser, which gives them the same ammount of progress as it would have taken in the 1st choice>

---

>   <i>ask a mentor for help</i> = 
	Cassy ask's help from < mentor >, they point out the different flaws in the 
	parser. Cassy fixes these issues. 
	< If player has chosen correctly and obtained a mentor this choice becomes 
	unlocked. Progress on the languege is achieved and the player is free to work on
	the next day >

---





--- 
- week 8:
< The hero prepares to confront the central ordeal, often approaching a dangerous 
location (literal or metaphorical) where their greatest fear or goal resides. >
< the player dives into the writing the backend of the languege: finghting the 
beast that is llvm >

Cassy is getting in close to the home stretch. Now Cassy has to choose a backend for 
the languege. The 1st choice is naturally llvm.

Llvm proves to be quite the beast.

---

> <i>Push on with llvm</i> = no progress is achieved, more stress
	Cassy strugles with llvm's convoluted system. Still, Cassy choses to push onward
	on this path.

---

> <i>Give up on llvm</i> = some progress is achieved, more stress
	Cassy strugles with llvm's convoluted system. Cassy decides to look for 
	alternatives. While doing so, Cassy stumbles upon different forums and discussions
	that resonate the same sentiment, of how awful llvm is to work with. After more
	research Cassy find QBE, a much simpler compiler backend.

---

> <i>Ask opinion from a friend </i> = some progess is achieved, no stress
	Cassy strugles with llvm's convoluted system. Cassy tells this to the friend. They
	tell Cassy that they've heard before about how awful to work with llvm is and that
	they even know a better alternative: qbe. Cassy, after a bit of research decides
	to use qbe instead.
	< this option is available only if the player aquired a friend by going to the 
	party, gives the same result as second option but with less stress accumulation>
---





---
- week 9: < just gameplay >
< if player goes the llvm route, they have to spend this week to make it work instead>





---
- week 10:

< if player has below x amount of studies >

---

> <i> Give up on the languege to study </i> = <cut's straight to ending 2>

---

> <i> Give up and try to use chat-gpt </i> = more progress, some stress
	Cassy decides to use the help of an llm. From this point on, Cassy starts using
	llm's for everything, from working on the languege to studies.

< else >
< just gameplay >





---
- week 11:

< if player went the llvm route >
Cassy makes the unfortunate mistake of updating the llvm version. This breaks the 
compiler and Cassy is forced to waste the week scouring through update logs and error
messeges.

< if player went with qbe >
< just gameplay >




## Return

---
- week 12:

After all of the hardships in the past months, the compiler is finaly ready to print 
it's first hello world to the console. Thankfully, due to meticulous testing and after
buckets of sweat lost in debugging, it worked, for the 1st time, from the 1st try.

< a lot of stress is removed >




---
- week 13:
Now, the final stretch for this semester/year is up, all that's left to do is to do
all the exams.





---

--- Endings ---

---


--- Ending 1 <the good ending>

< if player has max progress >

Cassy succesfully finishes this semester/year of university. The languege isn't very
popular but Cassy is satisfied with the result. 

## Epilogue:
Cassy succesfully finishes university. With new found knowledge and free time, Cassy
enbarcs once again on the journey to create a programming languege.

---


--- Ending 2 < the neutral ending >

< if player has not max progress or chouses to give up at month x, week y >

Cassy succesfully finishes this semester/year but feels down because the languege 
didn't reach it's goal/target of progress, this heavely demoralises Cassy.

## Epilogue:
Cassy finishes university with averege grades. Cassy get's a normal job as a web 
developer and completly forgets about the dream Cassy once had.

---


-- Ending 3 < the mediocre ending >
< if the player has started using chat gpt >

Cassy succesfully finishes this semester/year. 

## Epilogue
Cassy finishes university with stelar grades. With the confidence built up from the
last project, Cassy tries to make another programming languege with heavy help from
chat gpt, but the languege never takes off. Cassy tries over and over again but fails
each time, unable to learn from the previous mistakes.

---


--- Bad ending ---


< if player doesn't have a certain level before exam >

Cassy doesn't finish the semester and loses scholarship. The financial toll of paying
for studies is too heavy to bear so Cassy drops out. As a backup plan, Cassy finds a 
job at a restaurant and works as a cook there for the rest of Cassy's life.
