In his first week, Cassy finds that he won't have enough time to pour his all into both language deveopment and studying hard enough to get only the best grades.

*scene <university lecture>
<teacher>
"... On a separate note, if you are feeling sick or not well enough to attend a lecture, it's okey to stay at home or sleep longer."
"You are more important than your grades!"

<Cassy>
The teacher is quite accommodating.
Getting only the best results in uni isn't everything.

From that point on, Cassy made up a plan.
Be absent from as many pairs as allowed, yet, still pass the university!
That will leave more time to the most important - language development!
