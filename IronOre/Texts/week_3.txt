The lecture finishes uneventfully and Cassy gathers his backpack to go home.
Once Cassy enters his room, his phone virbrates signaling an new notification.

<Classmate>
"Hey, Cassy, there is going to be party on Saturday."
"Will you be there? :)"

Saturdays are free and that usually means more time to spend on language development.
Alternatively, Cassy could just relax all day on his own.
Or, answer his friend and show up at the party.

*language
<narator>
Cassy writes to his friend.
<Cassy>
"Sorry, I already have plans for this Saturday."
I should focus on what is more important in the feature!
Which is writing my programming language.

*relax
<narator>
Cassy writes to his friend.
<Cassy>
"Sorry, I already have plans for this Saturday."

*party
<narator>
Cassy writes to his friend.
<Cassy>
"Sure. See you there!"
This should be a good oppurtunity to make new friends.
